# The English Programming Language

English is a high-level, multi-paradigm, expressive, general purpose language optimized for sequential and concurrent communications. English has been successfully used in a wide variety of scenarios, such as long-term data storage, analog and digital arts, and text-based adventures, to name a few. To date, English is used on more than 1,456 million carbon-based devices.

English has been designed over the course of fourteen centuries. While no unified standard exists yet, the language adheres to the following principles:

- Portability: English follows a Write Once, Read Anywhere, Then Rewrite (WORATR) philosophy.
- Extensibility: Like Lua, English can borrow constructs and keywords from other languages.
- Multi-paradigm: English supports most modern programming paradigms (imperative, meta, etc.)
- Resilience: English programs can execute on organic hardware despite severe syntax errors.
- Polymorphism: English evolves over time without having to refactor existing codebases.

English's stability makes it ideal for long-term projects where data integrity is more important than precision: The last breaking change in the specifications happened five centuries ago and there are no plans for further major releases.

The English community is vibrant, with more than 150 distributions available. For a complete list of forks see [List of dialects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dialects_of_English). 
 
## Reserved words

English does not have reserved words, relying instead on a set of 470,000 keywords that can be used interchangeably.

## Tooling

Currently, the only compiler available is Wernicke. It requires a temporal lobe trained in social settings for at least three to four years, though better results can be achieved with training runs in excess of 30 years.
